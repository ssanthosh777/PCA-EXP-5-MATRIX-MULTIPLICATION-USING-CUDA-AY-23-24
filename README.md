<h1> <align=center> MATRIX MULTIPLICATION USING CUDA </h3>
  Implement Matrix Multiplication using GPU.</h3>

## AIM:
To perform Matrix Multiplication using CUDA and check its performance with nvprof.
## EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED:
Hardware – PCs with NVIDIA GPU & CUDA NVCC
Google Colab with NVCC Compiler
## PROCEDURE:
1.	Define Constants: Define the size of the matrices (SIZE) and the size of the CUDA blocks (BLOCK_SIZE).
2.	Kernel Function: Define a CUDA kernel function matrixMultiply that performs the matrix multiplication.
3.	In the main function, perform the following steps:
4.	Initialize Matrices: Initialize the input matrices ‘a’ and ‘b’ with some values.
5.	Allocate Device Memory: Allocate memory on the GPU for the input matrices ‘a’ and ‘b’, and the output matrix ‘c’.
6.	Copy Matrices to Device: Copy the input matrices from host (CPU) memory to device (GPU) memory.
7.	Set Grid and Block Sizes: Set the grid and block sizes for the CUDA kernel launch.
8.	Start Timer: Start a timer to measure the execution time of the kernel.
9.	Launch Kernel: Launch the matrixMultiply kernel with the appropriate grid and block sizes, and the input and output matrices as arguments.
10.	Copy Result to Host: After the kernel execution, copy the result matrix from device memory to host memory.
11.	Stop Timer: Stop the timer and calculate the elapsed time.
12.	Print Result: Print the result matrix and the elapsed time.
13.	Free Device Memory: Finally, free the device memory that was allocated for the matrices.
